The Odin Project : Instructions

1. Create a new project with create-react-app and get rid of the boilerplate as in the previous projects.

2. Think about the component and the folder structure. How could you set up your application? Which components or functionalities do you need?
    
3. You should have at least two pages (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.
    
4. To your homepage, you can add whatever you’d like! A few images or information will be totally fine; it doesn’t have to be something fancy. The main goal of the project is to focus on setting up the shopping cart. The homepage is there to practice routing using react-router-dom.
    
5. On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
    
6. Build individual card items for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
    
7. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
    
8. Make sure to test your app thoroughly using the React Testing Library. Take care that you don’t directly test react-router-dom, since it is an external library and the developers working on it must have tested the library already.
    
9. As usual, style your application so you can show it off!
    
10. Lastly, push the project to GitHub! Follow this link for instructions on how to deploy React applications with client-side routing to Github Pages. Be aware that the page will stay blank, unless you add import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom' and utilize a <HashRouter /> component in place of <BrowserRouter /> as GitHub Pages doesn’t support <BrowserRouter />. Alternatively, you can set up a redirect to index.html. For a more detailed description, read these parts of the React Router Docs on client-side routing and deploying using gh-pages.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
